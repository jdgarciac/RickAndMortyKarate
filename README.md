## The Rick and Morty API
Examples of API test-automation using the Rick and Morty API using Karate

Karate is the only open-source tool to combine API test-automation, mocks, performance-testing and even UI automation into a single, unified framework. The BDD syntax popularized by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy for even non-programmers. Powerful JSON & XML assertions are built-in, and you can run tests in parallel for speed.

Test execution and report generation feels like any standard Java project. But there's also a stand-alone executable for teams not comfortable with Java. You don't have to compile code. Just write tests in a simple, readable syntax - carefully designed for HTTP, JSON, GraphQL and XML. And you can mix API and UI test-automation within the same test script.
